### CCJS 652: Seminar in Juvenile Delinquency

* Course description (from University graduate catalog): analysis of delinquency and its control. As you can see, this catalog description is quite broad since juvenile delinquency encompasses a broad range of topics. My goal for this semester is to introduce you to a selection of significant theoretical, policy, and methodological issues pertaining to juvenile crime. Most of what we cover could be considered a "jumping-off" point for further exploration of the literature in each area.

* Meetings: This course is scheduled to meet on Mondays from 4-6:45pm in LeFrak 2165E and I plan to hold office hours on Tuesdays from 9-10:30am and by appointment (you can email me at rbrame@umd.edu).

* Course-related policies: In all matters, I will follow University guidance as outlined [here](https://gradschool.umd.edu/faculty-and-staff/course-related-policies).

* Course grades: I will grade everything in this class on a 12-point scale (A+ = 12, A = 11, A- = 10, B+ = 9, etc.). I will use 2 different formulas to calculate your grades: formula 1: class participation (10%), a mid-term exam (30%), a final exam (30%), and a policy paper (30%); formula 2: class participation (25%), mid-term exam (25%), final exam (25%), and policy paper (25%). I will assign your final grade based on the higher of the 2 scores. Exams will include a set of short-answer and essay questions (I will provide some example questions). Final numeric grades will be rounded to the nearest integer (i.e., a 10.5 rounds up to an 11 but a 10.4 rounds down to a 10).

* Class participation: I will base your class participation grade equally on the following items: (1) by noon on Fridays you will email me a set of discussion issues/questions based on that week's readings; my expectation is these will be at least 5 substantive points that are raised by the readings that merit us spending class time discussing them the following Monday; and (2) you are a regular and engaged participant in class discussion (I will rate your engagement in this area by both the frequency of your engagement and the quality of the comments raised; original observations, criticisms, and thoughts about directions for future work will be rated more highly than observations that simply repeat what is said in the reading). If I assess that your class participation grade is anything less than an A-, I will ask to meet with you so we can take corrective action. I will report provisional class participation grades when I return mid-term exams so you know where you stand at the halfway point of the semester.

* Paper: I am asking you to choose a paper topic related to juvenile crime policy that you will develop throughout the semester. The paper should: (1) be 15-20 double-spaced and 1-inch margin pages long (not including tables, figures, or references); (2) include a clear statement of the area being covered; (3) offer a critical (meaning you offer your own critical analysis not simply restating problems or issues that were pointed out by the authors themselves) and comprehensive (meaning you cast an appropriately wide net of literature coverage) synthesis of the literature in your chosen area; (4) describe a specific research project that would be both feasible to carry out and that would advance knowledge in that area (describe the gap that your study would address); and (5) explain the methodological strengths and weaknesses of the project you propose. Before the mid-term exam, each of you will deliver a 20-minute class presentation of the first three items. Between the time of the mid-term and final exams, each of you will offer a 30-minute presentation of the last 2 items. Q&A (which is considered class participation) will occur during the presentations. Your final paper should incorporate the comments, questions, and criticisms offered by your classmates and me. These presentations and papers are meant to serve as the foundation for a useful research project. On or about Monday 9/18, I will randomly assign you to a date to make your first presentation; on or about Monday 10/20, I will randomly assign you to a date to make your final presentation.
